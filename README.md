Dagger2 Example
=====================

This is just a sample Android project which demonstrates the way of integrating [Dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger) into your application. 

Additionally, this app also acts as a demo of [retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda), [lombok](http://projectlombok.org/) and [butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) usage in your android apps. Checkout the code to find [lambdas from Java8 and automatic boilerplate code generation](https://github.com/mgrzechocinski/dagger2-example/blob/master/app/src/main/java/net/grzechocinski/android/dagger2example/home/HomeActivity.java). 

Feature missing? Pull requests are kindly welcome :)
